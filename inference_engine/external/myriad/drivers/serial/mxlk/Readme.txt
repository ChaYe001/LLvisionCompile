mxlk - Linux host PCIe Serial driver

Supported Platform
==================

Linux - This driver has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and only builds
        when using Linux kernel v4.15 or above.

Overview
========

This is the PCIe Serial driver for Linux hosts. This driver implements the
protocol needed to communicate with Myriad X devices using the PCIe Serial
driver as well (OsDrvPcieSerial).

The PCIe Serial driver is the one used in the XLink stack when using PCIe as the
the communication channel. In this case, this driver must be loaded before
starting any XLink host application.

Driver build
============

NOTE: The user will need the kernel-devel packages installed on the Linux host
      to be able to build the PCIe Serial driver.

Copy the files contained in the "host" folder in any folder on the Linux host
platform.

Compile the driver using the following command:
    "make all"

To clean the driver object files, use the following command:
    "make clean"

Driver loading/unloading
========================

The driver can be loaded using the following command:
    "sudo insmod mxlk.ko"
or the following one:
    "make install"

To check the debug output generated by the driver upon loading, the user can use
the "dmesg" command (see "Expected output" section).

The driver can be unloaded using the following command:
    "sudo rmmod mxlk"

Expected output
===============

Immediately after the insertion of the driver, the user should find the
following debug print in the output of the "dmesg" command:
    "MXLK:INFO  - mxlk_version_check(L) -- versions, dev : A.B.C, host : X.Y.Z"
where:
  - L is the line number of the debug print in the driver's source code.
  - A.B.C and X.Y.Z are the version numbers of the device driver and the host
    driver, respectively.
